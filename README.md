# report_genai


## Description

General Use GenAI project for creating automated reports.

A multi-agent system with compartmented tasks

## Structure


## Features

### Agent Modularity and Specialization
Each agent has clear and powerful responsibilities:
- <mainAI>: Orchestrator and evolving SME
- <policyAI>: Policy abstraction and standardization
- <dataAI>: Dataset engineering
- <interpreterAI>: Analytical narration
- <vizAI>: Visual translation
- <reportAI>: Output composition and storytelling

This division makes the system easily extensible and testable.

### SME Cycle in <mainAI>
The design enables <mainAI> to:
- Absorb knowledge incrementally (datasets, interpretations, policies)
- Validate with domain-specific heuristics (e.g., underage credit card holders)
- Reflect and refine understanding
- This transforms <mainAI> from a passive dispatcher into an active learning and integration engine.

### Modular agent orchestration
Each agent has:
- A clear, focused scope
- Defined inputs/outputs
- Independence for scaling or fine-tuning

### SME loop in <mainAI>
The system is:
- Cumulative in knowledge
- Reflexive to anomalies and contradictions
- Verifiable through both internal and external validation

### Audit trail via <auditAI> and [execution trace]
This is a critical enabler for:
- Debugging
- Explainability
- Regulatory reporting (e.g., financial or medical applications)

### Strict I/O design
- All JSON
- Deterministic
- Assumptions explicitly called out (This makes the system testable, inspectable, and maintainable).
- Hallucination control (<interpreterAI> low temperature)

### Confidence control:
A [confidence_score] field in each agentâ€™s output helps <mainAI>:
- Prioritize insights
- Discard low-certainty elements
- Flag results for human review
